## TODO

All the stuff to do before first release:

- uLaunch specific settings (only one done yet is the selected theme) in config.json

- Settings menu -> both console ones (device name, etc) and uLaunch's ones (also TODO ^)

- User menu -> log off, change password, register password, delete or create users...

- Theme menu -> browse themes in the SD card and select which one to use

- Document entry system (adding custom NROs with possible custom argv to main menu)

- Result code system, with a custom module (currently using temp ones like 0xDEAD or 0xBABE)

- Fix small UI issues (menu crashes, etc), which rarely happen

- Polish UI (specially speaking of startup menu)

## Plans

This could be also considered as TODOs, but not really needed for a first release:

- Improve QDaemons's IPC with two services, one only for QMenu and the other one for any process to interact with uLaunch

- Wii-style pointer, which is working for normal homebrew (however small tests didn't work fine, need to test again)
